# Middleware to avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) problem

## Installation and Setup

This project is a Node JS project dedicated to prevent CORS issues with APIs.  
To get started, install node js and download/clone this project. Then,

1. `npm install`
2. `npx nodemon app.js`

## Usage

There are two requests you can make.

1. **GET** request to '/' will return the home of the browsable API.
2. **POST** request to '/' will return the requested URL's response. **NOTE:** POST expects JSON like this {"url": "**YOUR-URL**"}

Happy Coding!
